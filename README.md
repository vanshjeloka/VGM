Automation of the process of uploading VGM container data into the shipping company website (https://www.msc.com)

The Verified Gross Mass (VGM) declaration process was an essential but highly manual workflow within the logistics chain. It required the operations team to manage the end-to-end documentation and submission of VGM certificates for every container scheduled for dispatch. Initially, the process began with the preparation of an Excel sheet containing container data, followed by generating a combined VGM PDF document. To comply with documentation requirements, this single PDF had to be split into individual container-specific files. This task itself was tedious, as staff had to manually extract each page and rename it accurately according to the container number.

Once split, every PDF had to be manually matched with its corresponding row in the Excel sheet to ensure correctness. The final step required users to open the designated web portal, locate each container's form fields, and upload the correct file. This process was repeated for every container, on a daily basis. On average, this took between 4 to 6 hours per day, depending on volume. It was repetitive, tiring, and highly susceptible to error due to the number of steps involved.

A Python-based automation solution was introduced to streamline the VGM submission process. The script reads the Excel sheet and uses the information to automatically split the master PDF into single-page PDFs, each accurately renamed based on container numbers. These files are then validated and uploaded automatically to the appropriate portal using browser automation. Upload statuses are logged to ensure full transparency and traceability. The need for manual intervention has been eliminated entirely.

The automated solution has transformed a previously manual and time-consuming task into a fast, reliable process. The 45-50 minutes spent daily on this task has been reduced to less than 5 minutes. More importantly, the system runs with high accuracy, reducing the risk of incorrect file uploads. The freed-up time allows employees to focus on more productive tasks that require judgment and insight, significantly increasing operational efficiency.
